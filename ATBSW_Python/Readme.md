# Automate The Boring Stuff With Python

ATBSWP = Automate the Boring Stuff with Python

Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart is a comprehensive textbook and workbook used to learn and apply the Python programming language. 

Therefore, this reposirtory will act as a notebook and a journal to document what I have learned from ATBSWP as well a guide to refer to for future projects.

As such, this repository will contain exercises and basic programs made through studying the 20 chapters of Automate The Boring Stuff With Python.
